## Hi there 👋

The AI and Data Society at Manchester Metropolitan University brings together like-minded students who are interested in exploring the vast and exciting world of artificial intelligence and data science. From learning about the latest advancements in machine learning and natural language processing, to discussing the ethical implications of AI and its impact on society, our society provides a forum for students to engage with these rapidly-evolving fields. We host regular meetings, guest lectures, and hands-on workshops to help our members learn more about the latest developments in AI and data science. Whether you're an experienced programmer or just starting out, you'll find a welcoming community at the AI and Data Society.
